# GeoArchive

The GeoArchive is a loosely coupled architecture of interoperating diverse repositories containing important geoscientific data, information, and knowledge content. Through a software layer, the GeoArchive coordinates actions across these repositories to ensure their near and long-term viability as scientific assets. This Python package is one element of the software layer.
